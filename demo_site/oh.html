      <!--We will have scheduled office hours times. If you have questions outside of office hours, please ask on discord. Follow the Discord Invite link in collab to join our Discord server.
      
      
      **Office hours** Will be conducted over discord. Please read these rules carefully before attending your first office hours:
      
      
      1. Make sure you send your computing id to our course bot called `Turing` so we can verify that you belong to the class. You will not be able to participate in any discussions (including office hours) until you've done this.
      1. This server is for instructional use of the TAs and help with Algorithms in Summer of 2021. Discussion of anything that is irrelevant to the class should be restricted only to the `#off-topic` channel.
      1. Once you join our server you will be able to connect to the "Collaboration Spaces" voice channels. You can use these to chat about problems with other students. We're going to leave it up to the community to determine how to best use those.
      1. If you join during office hours and would like TA help, please also put the question/problem you'd like to discuss in `#help-queue`. This Channel will be used as a queue. Students can be pulled out of the middle of the queue so that the TA can work with several students at a time. Posts made more than 15 minutes before the current office hours will be assumed to be carry-over from the previous session, and therefore will be ignored.
      1. We will be using the `Closed OH` channels for individual office hours discussion. Once you've added yourself to the queue, please join the `waiting room` voice channel. A TA will move you into a `Closed OH` room when it's your turn on the queue. While in the waiting room, we encourage you to meet your fellow students!
      1. The `Open OH` channels are for group discussions. Feel free to join those at any time (even if you haven't added yourself to the queue).
      1. The `#tech-support` channel is intended for questions relating to course structures, e.g. "Where do I go to submit homework" or "The course webpage is down", etc.
      1. This Discord server is serving as replacement for face to face Office Hours and Piazza. If you have a question that you would put into text and get a text response, please ask it in the most relevant text channel. After this, either a fellow student or course staff will answer!-->
      <p>Course staff will be available to help you at the following times:</p>
