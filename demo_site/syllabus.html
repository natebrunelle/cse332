      <p>Lecture attendance is optional, but strongly encouraged. In the event you are unable to attend a lecture, recordings of lectures are automatically posted to Canvas under the Panopto tool.</p>
      <p>Both offerings of the course will share the same assignments, deadlines, TA office hours, etc. I will do my best to cover the same content in lectures on the same days, but since different people may learn different topics at different rates, there may be occasional drift.</p>

If you email, include either <q>CSE 332</q>, <q>332</q>, or <q>Data Structures</q> in the subject line to prevent your email from skipping my inbox and never getting read.</p>
      <p>Our TAs are students too, with duties and work outside of their TAing. Please do not ask them to act as your TA except in section or at the scheduled times they have listed as their office hours. They are also kind people; please don’t put them in the position of having to say no or (worse) being nice to you at the expense of their own schooling.</p>
      <h2 id="readings"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Readings</h2>
      <p>(Optional) <em>Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java 3rd Ed.</em>, Mark Allen Weiss, Addison Wesley: 2012, ISBN-10: 0132576279. Our course calendar will list sections of the textbook that are most relevant to the topic discussed in class that day. You may find the textbook useful to clarify topics and find more examples as well as to examine Java implementations of the data structures and algorithms discussed during lecture. We will not be assigning problems from the textbook. We will use a set of free on-line notes for the material on parallelism and concurrency.</p>
      <h2 id="lectures"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Lectures</h2>
      <p>I do my best to make lectures as valuable, engaging, and enlightening as possible for all students. For a schedule of lecture topics, please see the <a href="calendar.html">course webpage</a>. Although we believe nearly all students will benefit from attending all classes, we also respect that as mature (ideally) college students, you are entrusted to figure out how best to learn and make use of your time here. Hence, I will not have any in-class activities which impact your grade with the exception of the already-posted exams (midterm and final). I will make a best effort to post all lecture materials (recordings, slides documents, etc.) on the course webpage, including video recordings of lectures. Be advised that there are occasional technical difficulties which sometimes cause the recordings to fail, and even when they do succeed these recordings may not be an adequate substitute for attending class live.</p>
      <h2 id="tasks"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Tasks</h2>
      <p>All assignments will be posted and submitted either in class (for exams) or on Gradescope. All grading will be conducted on Gradescope. You will be asked to perform three kinds of evaluations:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Exercises</strong>: These are intended to help you to gain experience and familiarity with course concepts by applying them to novel scenarios beyond those presented in lecture and section. These will sometimes be written assignments, but most will be programming tasks (perhaps paired with written activities). You will have at least one exercise due per week. Several weeks will have two excercises due. In all cases the exercises will be released as soon as you can reasonably begin making progress on them, and you will have roughtly one week to complete them.</li>
      <li><strong>Concept Checks</strong>: These are intended to help you to identify conceptual gaps or misconceptions on course content early so that they may more easily be corrected. Each concept check will relate to just one course topic. Each course topic may be covered in one or across several lectures. Each concept checks is due on the day of the first section the occurs after we finish discussing the concept in lecture. For example, if we finish discussing a concept on a Friday, the concept check for that topic will be due on the following Thursday. The intention is that you are able to attempt the concept check, then ask questions in section before the deadline.</li>
      <li><strong>Exams</strong>: These are timed and proctored in-class and close-resource exams.These are intended to evaluate the quality of your learning of the most important topics in the course, and to motivate you to study, review, and retroactively reflect upon all that you’ve learned. Lists of topics and links to past exams will be provided in advance of each exam.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1 id="grading"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Grading</h1>
      <p>We will consider the grade assigned by the following weighted average (of percentages) to be a <strong>guideline</strong> for calculating grades.</p>
      <table>
      <thead>
      <tr class="header">
      <th style="text-align: left;">Task</th>

      <td style="text-align: left;">Exercises</td>
      <td style="text-align: center;">54%</td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">There will be 13 total, each counting for 4.5%, with the lowest exercise (other than EX12<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>) grade being dropped.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td style="text-align: left;">Concept Checks</td>
      <td style="text-align: center;">6%</td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">There will be 18 total, each counting for 0.33%.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td style="text-align: left;">Exams</td>
      <td style="text-align: center;">40%</td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">There will be 2 total, a midterm (counting for 15%) and a cumulative final exam (counting for 25%).</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>This numerical calculation is to be considered a <strong>guideline</strong> on your score in the course. Final grades may take other factors into account so that your grade is the most accurate reflection of your understanding of course materials.</p>
      <h2 id="gradepoint-guarantee"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Gradepoint Guarantee</h2>
      <p>To help you to keep track of your standing in the course and to interpret grades as they are returned, we will provide the following <q>Gradepoint Guarantees</q>. If your score in the course using the weighted average above is at or above the thresholds below, we guarantee you will receive a course GPA that is at least the amount shown. At the end of the quarter we may adjust these thresholds in order to maintain consistent grading with past offerings of the course, but we guarantee we will only relax them. That is, your final GPA may possibly be higher than those given, but will definitely not be lower.</p>

      </table>
      <h2 id="deadlines"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Deadlines</h2>
      <p>To facilitate timely feedback, exercises will not be accepted late. That being said, we are happy to consider any request for a deadline extension. These deadline extensions are intended to either grant submission flexibility for students who experience hardship during the open window of the assignment, or to grant a small amount of extra time to students who began the assignment in a timely manner, have made substantial progress before the deadline, but would have their grade be a more accurate reflection of their understanding if a minimal amount of extra time was allotted.</p>
      <p>To submit an extension request, fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/XeR2iRYCcK54MGCB6">this google form</a>, providing either:</p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>The hardship experienced (a high-level description like <q>ER visit</q> is fine, details are unnecessary), as well as the approximate amount of time lost due to the hardship and a suggested replacement deadline.</li>
      <li>A description of when you started the assignment, how much progress you’ve made, where you’ve gotten stuck, and a suggested replacement deadline.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To ensure that we can respond to these requests before the deadline, please submit the requests no later than 24 hours before the deadline whenever possible. Requests made beyond that window may not be processed before the assignment deadline, and therefore there is a risk of the request being denied after the deadline has already passed. Requests made after this time should include additional justification for why the request was delayed.</p>
      <h2 id="regrades"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Regrades</h2>
      <p>We acknowledge that professors and TAs are people (glad to get that confession off of my chest!), and people make mistakes. For this reason, you are able to request regrades on exercises and the midterm within either one week of your grade being returned or by Wednesday March 18, whichever date is sooner. You will only have 48 hours to submit regrade requests for the final exam.</p>
      <p>Please only submit a regrade request if you believe the rubric was misapplied to your submission or if there was a keying error for the task. In the case of a misapplication of the rubric, identify specifically what in your submission demonstrates the misapplication and suggest how you believe the rubric should be correctly applied. In the case of a keying error, state and justify why you believe your answer should be considered correct. Rubrics are produced and revised throughout the grading process to ensure they reflect the learning objectives of the course and can be applied equitably to all submissions. As such, disagreement with the existance or weighting of a rubric item is not considered a valid reason for a regrade request.</p>
      <h1 id="miscellanea"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Miscellanea</h1>
      <h2 id="professionalism"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Professionalism</h2>
      <p>Behave professionally.</p>
      <p>Never abuse anyone, including the emotional abuse of blaming others for your mistakes. Kindness is more important than correctness.</p>
      <p>Let our TAs be students when they are not on the clock as TAs.</p>
      <p>Lack of professionalism has an overall detrimental impact on our community of learning.</p>
      <h2 id="honesty"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Honesty</h2>
      <p>I always hope everyone will behave honestly. I know we all are sometimes tempted by the easy path that dishonesty can enable; if you do something you regret, the sooner you tell me the sooner (and more leniently) we can correct it.</p>
      <h3 id="no-plagiarism-nor-anything-like-it"><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> No plagiarism (nor anything like it)</h3>
      <p>For Exercises and Programming Projects you may use external materials with the following restrictions:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>You must attempt each task individually first, you should not consult other resources until you are <q>stuck</q>.</li>
      <li>You must understand everything you submit. Do not submit anything you could not explain to a member of the course staff.</li>
      <li>You <strong>may not</strong> collaborate or seek help from any interactive source except for members of the course staff or other currently-enrolled CSE332 students (this means you may not seek assistance from former CSE332 students, online forums like Chegg or Stackoverflow, or generative AI systems like Chat-GPT or CoPilot).</li>
      <li>You <strong>must</strong> cite any and every source you consult beyond officially-provided materials (i.e. the optional course texbook, the course webpage, the course staff, or any resources provided through official course channels). Included in your citation, you must identify which components of your submission came from each source (it will be understood that content with no citation is your own exclusive work). Your collaborators are considered to be sources, and so should be cited. An example citation might look like: <q>I collaborated with Brett Wortzman on the implementation of the peek method, I consulted  for help with java print syntax, Miya Natsuhara helped me to debug the for loop that begins on line 107 of my code.</q></li>
      <li>All collaborations with classmates must be <q>whiteboard only</q> (defined below).</li>
      <li>Do not seek <q>hints</q> or entire solutions to the problems. Limit your searching to background information only. (For example, do not consult a GitHub repository posted by a former student.)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="whiteboard-only-collaboration"><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1.1</span> Whiteboard Only Collaboration</h4>
      <p><q>Whiteboard Only</q> collaboration is meant to convey the type of discussion where participants gather around a whiteboard to solve a problem together, without taking any notes from their discussion, and then erasing the whiteboard before they disperse.</p>
      <p>In particular, you may discuss tasks and their solutions, but the only thing you may take away from your discussion is your brain. This means you may not produce any records or artifacts from your collaborations, including: notes, screenshots, photos, figures, code, audio/video recordings, documents (inluding google docs), links, or any other digital or tangible thing. Nor may you share any files, links, etc. with other students outside of a collaboration session. Any substantially similar expression of the same solution can only occur if collaboration extends beyond <q>whiteboard only</q>, and so will be considered as evidence of a policy violation.</p>
      <h2 id="personal-accommodations"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Personal accommodations</h2>
      <h3 id="special-circumstances"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Special Circumstances</h3>
      <p>The University of Washington strives to provide accessibility to all students. If you require an accommodation to fully access this course, please work with the Disability Resources for Students (DRS). If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, or to learn more about their services, begin by visiting <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/">the DRS website</a>. For this course, we ask that students with special circumstances let us know as soon as possible, preferably during the <strong>first week of class</strong> or as soon as accomodations are approved.</p>
      <h3 id="religious-observances"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> Religious observances</h3>
      <p>Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW’s policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at <a href="https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/">Religious Accommodations Policy</a>. Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using <a href="https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/">the Religious Accommodations Request form</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="safe-environment"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.3</span> Safe Environment</h3>
      <p>I am dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning enironment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I hold as critically important:</p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>Power-based violence is not to be tolerated</li>
      <li>Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community in the classroom and on campus.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, I encourage you to use Safecampus as a resource. As your professor and a human, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources to the best of my ability.</p>
      <p>Additionally, if at any point you are made to feel uncomfortable, disrespected, or excluded by a staff member or fellow student, please report the incident so that we may address the issue and maintain a supportive and inclusive learning environment. Should you feel uncomfortable bringing up an issue with a me or another staff member directly, you may consider contacting the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/ombud/">Office of the Ombud</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="life"><span class="header-section-number">3.3.4</span> Life</h3>
      <p>Bad things happen. People forget things and make mistakes. Bad days coincide with due dates. Etc.</p>
      <p>If you believe that circumstances warrant a change in deadline, a second chance, or some other accommodation in order to more accurately synchronize grade with knowledge, come talk to me and we’ll resolve the situation as best we can.</p>
      <p>If you are feeling overwhelmed, stressed, or isolated, there are many individuals here who are ready and wanting to help. The University of Washington Counseling Center offers short-term counseling students and crisis service for urgent situations. Call 206-543-1240 (or 866-427-4747 for after hours and weekend crisis assistance) to get started and schedule an appointment.</p>
