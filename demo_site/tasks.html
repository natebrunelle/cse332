      ### Past Exams
      
      
      Below I have several quarters' midterm exams. Be advised that the question style, length, difficulty, and content may differ among quarters. Most notably, prior quarters covered two data structures that have been omitted from the course this quarter - Tries and B-Trees. In lieue of those, the autumn 2024 exam will cover hash tables and hashing. Questions relating to hashing can be found within the sample final exams below.
      
      ~~In addition, approximately 1 week before the exam I will post one custom-created practice exam that accounts for the content differences compared to previous quarters. This exam will be constructed by selecting questions from among the past midterms and finals already provided on this page.~~
      
      I have created a [sample midterm exam](files/cse332-frankenmidterm-24au.pdf) (with [solutions](files/cse332-frankenmidterm-24au-soln.pdf)) for your reference. This exam was generated by omitting some questions from the 24 summer midterm, and adding in hashing questions from the 24 summer final. 
      
      Overall, here is how I would recommend that you use these sample exams to prepare. 
      
      - First, study on your own without using any of the provided sample exams. To do this, review the exercises, lecture slides, and section materials. If there are things included in these that you find confusing or do not recall, seek clarification. This can be done by reviewing lecture recordings, talking with classmates, or attending office hours.
      - Next, use the past exams below to evaluate your preparedness. Attempt some problems, then compare your answer against the solution provided. If they differ, try to diagnose whether your answer is equally valid, or else where you may have a misconception (you're welcome to come to office hours for help!). 
      - Once you are confident with your ability to answer questions in the past exams, take the practice exam above as a simulation of the actual exam (so create your reference sheet and then set aside a 50 minute block of time to take the exam from start to finish). Then trade exams with a friend so that they can compare your solutions to the answer key and give you feedback.
      - Use this feedback to decide where to review.
      
      Past Exams:

      ### Policies
      
      In case you're the type who likes to read the instructions before walking in on exam day, here is the actual [exam cover page](files/final_cover.pdf)!
      
      1. Closed book, closed notes except for a 1-page 2-sided reference sheet of your own creation.
      1. No calculators, cell phones, or other electronic devices allowed.
      1. No writing after time is called, make sure you put your name on your paper first.
      1. You will be provided a [reference sheet](files/cse332_final_wi24_reference.pdf) (tentative) during the exam.
      
      ### Content
      
      The final exam will cover:
      
      - Midterm exam material listed above.
      - Sorting
          - Definitions, procedures, running times, and other properties of these algorithms:
              - Selection Sort
              - Insertion Sort
              - Heap Sort
              - Merge Sort
              - Quick Sort
              - Bucket Sort
              - Radix Sort
      - Graphs
          - The definitions of the many terms presented in the graphs section, including: 
              - node/vertex
              - edge, edge weight
              - directed/undirected graph
              - (in/out) degree
              - complete graph
              - simple graph
              - path, simple path, and cycle
              - connected graph
              - DAG
              - tree
              - Any other definitions presented in the slides
          - Graph data structures (adjacency list, adjacency matrix) and the advantages and disadvantages of each.
          - Graph Traversals (breadth-first search and depth-first search)
          - Dijkstra's Algorithm
          - Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's Algorithm
          - Topological Sort
      - Parallelism:
          - ForkJoin Parallelism
          - Efficiency analysis (including work, span, perfect linear speedup, and Amdahl's Law)
          - ForkJoin applications:
              - Reduce: Parallel sum, max, find, etc.
              - Map: vector addition, function application, etc.
          - Parallel Prefix Sum
          - Parallel Filter
      - Concurrency
          - Race Conditions:
              - Data Races
              - Bad Interleavings
          - Code Synchronization:
              - Locks, reentrant locks
              - Java's Synchronized statement
              - Lock scheme granularity (coarse vs. fine)
              - Critical section size
              - Deadlock
      
      Note: You will likely be asked to write java code using ForkJoin and/or threads. We will not require your syntax to be perfectly correct, but it should be correct enough that we can verify the code's would be correct if syntax issues were fixed. That is, we expect edge cases and other considerations of an algorithm to be correct, but don't necessarily expect all keywords or semicolons to be perfect.
      
      ### Past Exams
      
      I have created a [sample final exam](files/cse332-frankenfinal-24au.pdf) (with [solutions](files/cse332-frankenfinal-24au-soln.pdf)) for your reference. This exam was generated by: 1) removing the section on hashing from 24 summer final (since that was midterm material this quarter), adding in the cumulative questions from the winter 2024 final, then adding couple more questions to pre-existing sections to compensate the length fro the removal of the hashing section (including a hashing question that was added to the cumulative section).
      
      We have provided links to past exams below. Be advised that in other quarters the final exam has included P/NP content. Your final exam for this quarter will not include that material. Additionally, in previous quarters Hashing was not covered on the midterm, and so expect to have that material constitute a much smaller portion of your final compared to those below. I recommend that you mostly use these exams to evaluate your preparedness rather than as a study guide.
