      <p>Below I have several quarters’ midterm exams. Be advised that the question style, length, difficulty, and content may differ among quarters. Most notably, prior quarters covered two data structures that have been omitted from the course this quarter - Tries and B-Trees. In lieue of those, the autumn 2024 exam will cover hash tables and hashing. Questions relating to hashing can be found within the sample final exams below.</p>
      <p><del>In addition, approximately 1 week before the exam I will post one custom-created practice exam that accounts for the content differences compared to previous quarters. This exam will be constructed by selecting questions from among the past midterms and finals already provided on this page.</del></p>
      <p>I have created a <a href="files/cse332-frankenmidterm-24au.pdf">sample midterm exam</a> (with <a href="files/cse332-frankenmidterm-24au-soln.pdf">solutions</a>) for your reference. This exam was generated by omitting some questions from the 24 summer midterm, and adding in hashing questions from the 24 summer final.</p>
      <p>Overall, here is how I would recommend that you use these sample exams to prepare.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>First, study on your own without using any of the provided sample exams. To do this, review the exercises, lecture slides, and section materials. If there are things included in these that you find confusing or do not recall, seek clarification. This can be done by reviewing lecture recordings, talking with classmates, or attending office hours.</li>
      <li>Next, use the past exams below to evaluate your preparedness. Attempt some problems, then compare your answer against the solution provided. If they differ, try to diagnose whether your answer is equally valid, or else where you may have a misconception (you’re welcome to come to office hours for help!).</li>
      <li>Once you are confident with your ability to answer questions in the past exams, take the practice exam above as a simulation of the actual exam (so create your reference sheet and then set aside a 50 minute block of time to take the exam from start to finish). Then trade exams with a friend so that they can compare your solutions to the answer key and give you feedback.</li>
      <li>Use this feedback to decide where to review.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Note: You will likely be asked to write java code using ForkJoin and/or threads. We will not require your syntax to be perfectly correct, but it should be correct enough that we can verify the code’s would be correct if syntax issues were fixed. That is, we expect edge cases and other considerations of an algorithm to be correct, but don’t necessarily expect all keywords or semicolons to be perfect.</p>
      <!--The final exam is not designed to be cumulative in that there may be questions designed to specifically test on content from the midterm. However, knowledge of all content from the midterm will be assumed, and so some questions may incidentally involve midterm material. For example, a question relating to sorting may involve evaluating the running time of code. A question involving graphs may require knowledge of trees.

      <h3 id="past-exams-1"><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Past Exams</h3>
      <p>I have created a <a href="files/cse332-frankenfinal-24au.pdf">sample final exam</a> (with <a href="files/cse332-frankenfinal-24au-soln.pdf">solutions</a>) for your reference. This exam was generated by: 1) removing the section on hashing from 24 summer final (since that was midterm material this quarter), adding in the cumulative questions from the winter 2024 final, then adding couple more questions to pre-existing sections to compensate the length fro the removal of the hashing section (including a hashing question that was added to the cumulative section).</p>
      <p>We have provided links to past exams below. Be advised that in other quarters the final exam has included P/NP content. Your final exam for this quarter will not include that material. Additionally, in previous quarters Hashing was not covered on the midterm, and so expect to have that material constitute a much smaller portion of your final compared to those below. I recommend that you mostly use these exams to evaluate your preparedness rather than as a study guide.</p>
