## Zach Bi

Hello, my name is Zachary. I’m a current Junior studying CS: DS and I’ve TAed a lot, but this is my first time doing the major version of DSA. I used to do a lot of Leetcode and working out but I dropped all my hobbies to prioritize sleeping, working on my car, and playing badminton weekly. I look forward to a great quarter with y’all.
